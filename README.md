## 📖 Abstract

Flare artifacts such as halos, ghosting, and internal reflections often degrade visual quality in autonomous driving scenarios, particularly under adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, or rapid pressure shifts across windshields. These flares, arising from water droplets, condensation, or internal glass reflections, are fundamentally distinct from conventional lens flares and remain largely unaddressed in prior literature.

In this work, we present the first systematic effort to model and remove such reflective flares that appear in real-world driving videos. Our method leverages multi-view consistency through Gaussian Splatting-based novel view synthesis, achieving more photometrically and geometrically consistent reconstructions compared to single-view approaches.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **🌊 Physics-based Synthetic Pipeline**: We introduce a controlled synthetic dataset that simulates flare formation using physics-informed rendering
- **🔍 Depth-guided Uformer Architecture**: A multi-modal restoration framework that fuses flare-degraded RGB inputs with flare-invariant depth priors
- **🎨 Gaussian Splatting Framework**: Novel view synthesis that enhances multi-view consistency and facilitates accurate reconstruction of flare-free scenes
- **📊 Comprehensive Evaluation**: Significant improvements in both visual fidelity and downstream tasks (segmentation, optical flow) under adverse weather conditions

  <p><em>Our depth-guided Uformer architecture leverages depth information to better disentangle flare artifacts from scene content.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong> Our multi-modal architecture fuses flare-corrupted RGB inputs with flare-invariant depth priors from LiDAR sensors. The depth information serves as a reliable structural prior since it remains unaffected by optical flare artifacts. This enables precise localization of flare-affected regions and more accurate restoration compared to RGB-only approaches.</p>
